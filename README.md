*Improved data processing*

LibCapableData, or LibCD, is a suite of hooks to make data packs easier for both mod and pack developers. Conditions 
allow for conditional loading of data pack elements, ~~and Tweakers allow programmatic adding and modifying of recipes,
 loot tables, and more.~~ SEE COMMENT BELOW

## Conditions
Conditions are a framework for data-driven conditional loading of data pack elements. They're added with a `.mcmeta` 
system like resource pack metadata is. Tags are also given a `libcd` block for conditional entries outside of 
all-or-nothing loading.





# What happened to LibCD?

Long story short, drama happened. Tweakers caused a lot of drama, and when someone who had been causing me grief for a 
while said that libcd was obsolete due to their new mod, I agreed. LibCD is now primary geared towards developers, and 
pared down massively in scale. It become actively damaging to my health to continue maintaining it in the state it was 
in. There will be a successor to tweakers, but it will be pared back as well. I have plans for what I'd like to see out
of its new iteration.
